# Machine Learning Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms in C++. With possibility of releasing an Windows App for it

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **KNN (In Progress)**: The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is currently being implemented. (Work In Progress)

## Directory Structure

-   `include/`: This folder contains header files for the project. (You need to include these files in you program)
    -   `header.hpp`: A sample header file.
-   `src/`: This folder contains source files for the project. (Do not modify this folder contents)
    -   `headerimpl.cpp`: A sample source file that includes `header.hpp`.

## Usage

Coming soon! This section will be updated once the project is implemented correctly.

## Notes

This README will be updated as the project progresses. Stay tuned!
